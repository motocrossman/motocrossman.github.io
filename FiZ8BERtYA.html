					 <strong>7 myths about nutrition that science refutes</strong><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><div><div></div></div><p><span>Whether it's information posted on popular websites or advice from friends that sounds pretty convincing, don't believe everything you hear or read. Many myths about nutrition and fitness come from they spread very quickly from an unverified source, and people start taking them for granted. Below we will reveal the truth about 7 statements that are often found on the web.</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 1: it takes 21 days to get rid of a bad habit (or develop a new one).</b></span></p><p><span>Many popular and self-proclaimed fitness experts claim that you can get rid of a bad habit or form a new one in just 21 days. The point is that there is no precise time frame within which sustained changes will occur. Some people can develop a new habit (for example, include more vegetables on the menu) in just a few minutes several days. In other cases, this process may take weeks or months. A study published in the European Journal of Psychology shows that it takes an average of 66 days to form new habits. However, everything is strictly individual. Scientists have found out that the time of adaptation depends on the characteristics of both the habit itself and the environment. human's. If you are trying to start something new, such as daily exercise, take the time to make it a routine practice. And remember that it will not take one night or even 21 days!</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 2: the oil can to lubricate the joints.</b></span></p><p><span>Can oil lubricate your joints? Probably Yes, but not in the way it is presented "some people do. There are studies that show that omega-3 fatty acids, usually found in oily fish (salmon), walnuts, and Flaxseed, can ease joint pain. They are believed to reduce inflammation, which in turn reduces pain. A study of fish oil and joint pain found, that participants who took fish oil supplements reported less morning stiffness, reduced swelling and joint pain, and reduced need for anti-inflammatory aides to control symptoms.</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 3: muscle can turn into fat (and Vice versa).</b></span></p><p><span>Muscles and adipose tissue are completely different components of the body, so they can not pass into each other. When you stop training, there is a decrease in muscle mass. Weight gain occurs at the expense of more calories consumed than expended. Achieving such a state is a simple task when there is no muscle tissue with high metabolic capacity, allowing the body to move with maximum power. The most important thing is to be active. If you have stopped exercising, it is best to reduce your food intake so as not to gain extra weight.</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 4: canola oil is derived from rapeseed (and it's toxic!).</b></span></p><p><span>According to many people, the oil canola is derived from rapeseed, but it is actually a product of pressed canola seeds themselves.</span></p><p><span>While rapeseed oil contains very high levels of erucic acid (a compound that can be toxic to humans in large quantities), canola oil contains very low levels of this acid. Misinformation about this may be related to the fact that canola was collected in the 1960s using a traditional cross between rapeseed seeds in order to reduce the content of erucic acid and glucosinolates in rapeseed oil. Although canola oil is by definition not a genetically modified product, 90% of crops have been grown since 2010 with this plant have been genetically modified (GMO) to be more resistant to pesticides. If you want to avoid GMOs, focus on organic canola oil or expeller (a material extracted mechanically, not chemically, at about 50 ° C).</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 5: "cleansing with juices" is the best tool for long-term weight loss.</b></span></p><p><span>Recently, the advertising of" cleansing " with the help of juices has become very popular. For most healthy people, following this regimen from time to time will not cause harm, but it can still cause feelings of hunger and fatigue. If you really want to improve your body's health, you need to exercise regularly, to ensure the quality of sleep and stick to a healthy and varied diet.</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 6: some foods (such as celery) are a source of "negative" calories.</b></span></p><p><span>When something sounds too good to be true, it usually turns out to be not this way. The term "food with negative calories" sounds really great, but unfortunately, there is no such thing. The myth of "negative calories" comes from the idea that some foods burn more calories than they produce. The erroneous logic in this urban legend is rooted in the idea of a thermal effect the amount of energy required to break it down can lead to negative caloric intake. Celery, apples, and limes are among the advertised foods with similar properties. The truth is that there are no products with negative caloric values. The usual TEF range is 10-20% of the the total number of calories in the food. For example, let's say that celery contains 7 calories. Assuming that the TEF is 20%, this means that there are 5.5 calories left.</span></p><p><span><b>Myth 7: fresh food is always better than frozen.</b></span></p><p><span>Frozen foods can contain the same or greater amount of nutrients substances than fresh food. In practice, frozen fruits and vegetables are Packed a few hours after harvest, thus locking in valuable vitamins and minerals. At the same time, fresh food can be stored for several days or even weeks before reaching the consumer and being eaten, which means that this will lead to the loss of important nutrients. A healthy diet can include both fresh and frozen foods.</span></p><div></div>
